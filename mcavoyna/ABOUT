Something good about my implementation: My object-oriented model for a player.
Player is just a virtual class that specifies a virtual method "getMove." So
the "HumanPlayer" and "RandomPlayer" classes used the same interface, and it
was really easy to plug in different combinations of them.

Something bad about my implementation: There's a nasty memory leak which I 
wasn't able to get to the bottom of.
